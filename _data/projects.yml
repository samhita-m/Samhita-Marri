  company: Mahindra Ecole Centrale                                
  dates: August 2016 - May 2017
  description: | 
    - Worked in a team of three on denoising heart sound using algorithms like AR, MA, ARMA, ALE, RLS and Kalman. 
    - Performed a comparative study on these algorithms based on their noise reduction ratio and heart sound recovery. 
    - Implemented classification algorithms like Bayesian, K-mean, SVM, ANN and did a comparative study.
